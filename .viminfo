	        <h2>What does freedom mean?</h2>
	
	            <p>See this article in video form <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/modern-freedom-means-being-a-slave-to-impulses">here</a>.</p>
	
	        <p>Which of the following two people is more free:</p>
	        <ol>
	            <li>A drug addict.</li>
	            <li>A average man who is only not a drug addict because he lives in a country where drugs are regulated or shamed in a way to make them hard to obtain.</li>
	        </ol>
	        <p>
	        Most modern people will have a kind of cognitive dissonance, a kind of glitch in their matrix here.
	        In the modern view of freedom, freedom means the ability to do what you want without the government or society telling you what to do, so (1), the drug addict, should be more "free."
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        But at the same time, this feels wrong.
	        (2) probably lives a better life.
	        He is more suited to make more and better decisions.
	        Someone addicted to drugs is highly constrained in the kind of life they have to live to fulfill their addiction.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        Even extreme libertarians will probably say (2) is in a better place, but might chalk things up to (1) needing to have more discipline
	        and they'll make up some just-so story as for why unambiguously bad drugs, or pornography, or dangerous things should be allowed anyway.
	        </p>
	
	        <h2>Classical freedom</h2>
	
	        <a href="pix/paul.jpg"><img src="pix/paul.jpg" alt="Paul" class="resright"></a>
	
	        <p>
	        In reality, since the Enlightenment, we have had a hobbled understanding of what "freedom" is.
	        Enlightenment "freedom" is only the freedom to perfectly follow the whims of impulses and vices indiscriminately.
	        </p>
	
	        <h3>The Christian tradition</h3>
	        <p>
	        Christians stated the classical view of freedom very clearly.
	        Paul writes that all men are either "slaves to Christ" or "slaves to sin."
	        The modern man wants to retort that he doesn't want to be a slave to anything, but wants to be his own master, but there is really no such thing.
	        </p>
	
	        <p>
	        One can be guided by Christ, or more generally, by consistent moral principles, restraint and forethought.
	        Or one can abandon the pretense of morality and by definition follow his impulses to fornication, substance-abuse, and general reckless living.
	        </p>
	
	        <p>
	        These masters aren't equivalent either.
	        Being a slave to one is nothing like being a slave to another.
	        Slaves to sin are wrapped up into incoherent and uncontrollable behavior.
	        Following one's sexual whims might be inconsistent and thoughtless behavior that one likes one second and is disgusted by the next.
